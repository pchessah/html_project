              Firefighting Career Individuals who seek out a career in
              firefighting do not do so to become wealthy. Considering the
              personal risk and sacrifices firefighters make on a regular basis,
              their salaries are relatively meager. According to 2008 statistics,
              a firefighterâ€™s average hourly pay was a mere $21.97. A full-time
              professional in the career of firefighting can expect to make
              between $22,000 and $50,000 per year, while others are not paid at
              all.

            <li>
              Many volunteer firefighters provide their valuable services at no
              charge - just wanting to give back to their towns and cities while
              receiving on-the-job training. Needless to say, fighting fires is
              intense, difficult, and very dangerous work. Firefighters exercise
              daily and participate in special training drills to ensure that they
              are physically ready to meet their arduous tasks when the alarm
              sounds. These brave individuals often need to walk into a burning
              building to rescue those who are trapped by the fire. They expose
              themselves to toxic gases, falling roofs and walls, and of course,
              the powerful force of fire itself. While saving others, their
              personal safety is on the line. Emergency Medical Services It is
              sometimes necessary for firefighters to provide emergency medical
              services during their rescue operations, especially when they find
              victims suffering from smoke inhalation, and/or unconscious. If
              emergency medical assistance (EMT) has not yet arrived on the scene,
              it will be up to the rescuer to attempt to bring the person back to
              consciousness.

              Those that have been hurt often need to be calmed, reassured, and
              consoled until the ambulance arrives. Heroic Traits Doing the
              important work of protecting lives and property from devastating
              fires takes more than just training and physical competence. The job
              requires a strong character comprised of incredible courage,
              self-discipline, a passion for serving others, and decision-making
              skills in the midst of emotionally-charged situations. Firefighters
              typically possess interpersonal and social skills as they need to
              work closely with their colleagues in order to form a united team.
              Because of their shared attributes, the common obstacles they face,
              and the numerous hours they spend training together, these
              professionals often establish bonds that rival those typically found
              amongst siblings. Firefighters work very long hours, sometimes
              living at the fire station for days at a time.

              They are committed to their jobs and take the work of protecting
              their communities and each other very seriously. They often
              volunteer their precious time to schools and other organizations in
              order to help educate others about the dangers of fires, how to
              prevent them, and what to do in the event of a fire. Kudos to our
              firefighters!
